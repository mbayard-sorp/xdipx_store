# Cloud Routine Schedule Manifest

The agent-plane routines run in Claude's cloud scheduler, outside this repo. This manifest is the
versioned source of truth for what should be scheduled: routine names, cadences, and the exact
scheduled prompt each fires with (fresh session per fire, completion notifications off). If the
scheduler and this file disagree, fix one of them — the weekly strategy routine should verify each
expected routine actually ran (the runs table has the data) and file a suggestion when one is
missing.

Status 2026-07-09: **created**. All 8 triggers below exist in Claude's cloud scheduler (fresh
session per fire, completion notifications off), each firing the exact prompt in this manifest.
Trigger IDs, for reference when editing or deleting a routine:

| # | Name | Trigger ID |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | xdipx — Weekly Strategy | `trig_018pSqtCKWC3fxbstN7wQBvs` |
| 2 | xdipx — Apply Pass (agent-editor) | `trig_018kKMQRtD6a5XPUJu5aVPK5` |
| 3 | xdipx — Cost Review (process-optimizer) | `trig_01S2ha8LYtKkpZ7JoPGAJKKZ` |
| 4 | xdipx — Ads Proposals | `trig_013PfuKac4rkjPTHuUwXWzRn` |
| 5 | xdipx — Email Briefs | `trig_01FkT8YQZJWvPqVQ8nBEPzjq` |
| 6 | xdipx — Social Drafts | `trig_01CKe93nZQ1uQqqDZLpQ5GG8` |
| 7 | xdipx — Daily Merchandiser (Routine A) | `trig_01PEat4JFm4fVmbNQKomSVMS` |
| 8 | xdipx — Design Cycle (Routine B) | `trig_017s5fsNnWgk7xpXgF8QZccB` |

Still outstanding: smoke-test by firing Weekly Strategy manually (`fire_trigger` on
`trig_018pSqtCKWC3fxbstN7wQBvs`) and confirm the run row plus gate state on
`/admin/homepage-team?team=strategy` — gate-closed skip before migration 052 is applied, a full run
after. The weekly strategy routine's own first scheduled fire also verifies the other 7 ran, going
forward.

## Common prompt skeleton

Every prompt below follows the same shape: work in the xdipx_store repo; read the binding mission
brief (`docs/store-team/mission-brief.md`, or `docs/homepage-team/mission-brief.md` for the
homepage team) and `docs/emma-voice.md`; follow the named playbook exactly; start the run via
`POST https://xdipx.com/api/team/run` (header `x-team-secret: $TEAM_TOKEN`, falling back to
`$HOMEPAGE_TEAM_TOKEN` / `$CRON_SECRET`); **gate first** via
`GET https://xdipx.com/api/team/gate?team=<team>&excludeRun=<run id>` and on `ok:false` post a
skipped event, finish the run honestly, and exit cleanly; end with the playbook's retro step; log
spend via `POST https://xdipx.com/api/homepage-team/spend` under the team's feature label.

## The 8 routines

| # | Name | Cron (UTC) | Team / feature label | Playbook | Extra prompt clauses |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | xdipx — Weekly Strategy | `0 12 * * 1` | strategy / `strategy-weekly` | `docs/store-team/routine-weekly-strategy.md` | Run as store-strategist with the inventory-sentinel, promo-manager, loyalty-referral-manager, and product-manager sub-steps. Advisory only: publish the brief, file/route suggestions, never operate. |
| 2 | xdipx — Apply Pass (agent-editor) | `0 20 * * 1` | strategy / `strategy-apply` | `docs/store-team/routine-agent-editor.md` | Step 0: if `suggestion_apply_enabled` is not `'true'`, exit without starting a run. Owner-APPROVED suggestions of kind instructions/agent-def/config only; one minimal-diff PR per suggestion on branch `agents/suggestion-<id>`; max 5/run; allowlisted files only; NEVER merge or push to the default branch; refuse anything that weakens valves, the voice gate, MAP, or the loop's human gates. |
| 3 | xdipx — Cost Review (process-optimizer) | `0 21 * * 1` | strategy / `strategy-cost-review` | `.claude/agents/process-optimizer.md` + `docs/store-team/improvement-loop.md` | Read recent runs/events/`api_token_log` cost + outcomes across every team; file suggestion rows with estimated $ savings and an explicit CX-risk note. Propose only; no self-rewiring. |
| 4 | xdipx — Ads Proposals | `0 13 * * 2` | ads / `ads-planning` | `docs/store-team/routine-ads-weekly.md` | PROPOSE-ONLY: write `ad_campaigns` proposals with a substantive policyCheck citing `docs/ads-policy.md`; never create/edit/activate/boost anything on any platform; you spend no money, ever. Max 3 proposals/run. |
| 5 | xdipx — Email Briefs | `0 15 * * 2` | email / `email-planning` | `docs/store-team/routine-email-weekly.md` | PLAN-ONLY: file campaign briefs as suggestions (kind campaign) for the owner to execute in Klaviyo; send nothing. Max 2 briefs/run. |
| 6 | xdipx — Social Drafts | `0 14 * * *` (daily) | social / `social-drafts` | `docs/store-team/routine-social-daily.md` | DRAFT-ONLY: every draft passes the emma-empathy-reviewer voice gate, then lands as a `social_posts` row with status `draft`. Never post live; never touch `social_team_autopost`. |
| 7 | xdipx — Daily Merchandiser (Routine A) | `0 10 * * *` (daily) | homepage / `homepage-*` | `docs/homepage-team/routine-daily-merchandise.md` | Entry agent homepage-orchestrator; mission brief is `docs/homepage-team/mission-brief.md`; content auto-publish within the gate/budget/image caps; never code changes. |
| 8 | xdipx — Design Cycle (Routine B) | `0 14 * * 3` (Wed) | homepage / `homepage-build` | `docs/homepage-team/routine-design-cycle.md` | Build on a branch and open a PR; never auto-merge; stop at the open PR. |

Times chosen for a US-Eastern owner: strategy Monday 8a ET, apply/cost-review Monday afternoon
after the owner's suggestion review, ads/email Tuesday morning, social daily 10a ET, merchandiser
daily 6a ET, design cycle Wednesday 10a ET.

## Access checklist (per routine)

Same as `docs/homepage-team/README.md`: scheduled Claude cloud session with repo access, the team
callback secret (`TEAM_TOKEN` / `HOMEPAGE_TEAM_TOKEN`) in its secret store, GA4 MCP where the agent
def lists it, and (ads only) the read/insights Meta Ads MCP tools named in
`.claude/agents/ads-manager.md`. All routines no-op at the gate until migration 052 is applied.
